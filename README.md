# Vulnerability Detector Spring WebApp

This vulnerability detector was developed during a university security project from scratch. 

The backend was developed in **java**. We used the [Spring Boot Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to get our WebApp running quickly. For the 
controller from the backend to the frontend we used [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
We choose a noSQL database (MongoDB) for the backend. 

# Requirements
- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/de)


# Setup
### 1. Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/Annabelita/vulnerability_detector.git
```

### 2. Create JAR with Maven
In your commandline change directory (cd) into the project. Then run:
```
mvn install
```

<br>
<br>

### 3. Start the WebApp
- Our project can easily be setup by running the JAR file

```
cd target
java -jar schwachstellen-detektor-0.0.4-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
You should now see the Spring Logo in your command line.

- Alternativly you can just double click on the jar file
- Go to localhost:8080. You should now see our startpage:

### 4. Database queries
- if you want to use the **Search** or **Detect** funktion please make sure to have your MongoDB database setup and running
- **Search**: Search for vulnerabilites in the DB
- **Detect**: Reads your systems registry and maps vulnerabilities from the DB. Returns a list of all potential vulnerabilites on your laptop. 
- Detect was tested for macOS High Sierra and Win10. Potentially the App also supports Linux (not fully tested).
